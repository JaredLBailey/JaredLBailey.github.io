Over the past semester I’ve been diving into the world of robotics simulation using MoveIt2 and RViz in ROS 2. My project centers around learning to operate the UR5E robot arm using Gazebo for simulation. This work is a stepping stone to using the physical UR5E arm owned by Duke University later this semester.

# Controlling the UR5E with Python <a name="ur5e"></a>

In my simulations, I’ve been using Python scripts to control the UR5E’s movements. My code takes advantage of both joint angle selections and pose selections to guide the robot through block stacking tasks. Joint angle selection gives me control over each specific joint of the robot, while pose selection allows for specifying the position and orientation of the robot’s end effector. Together, these methods enable precise and flexible control of the arm's movements.

# Designing a Custom Robot Arm with Fusion360 and RViz <a name="simulating"></a>

Taking my simulation attempts to the next level, I designed a custom robot arm to remove lightbulbs in high places such as museums and libraries. The robot arm includes a coiled end effector to both grab and twist the lightbulbs.
