# Overview
In this post I'll create a function in Python that can quickly find the largest integer divisor in common between two whole numbers. For example, if I pass the function a value of 100 and 150, then the function would find the largest common divisor to be 50 (100/50 = 2, 150/50 = 3). No larger number can divide evenly into 100 and 150.
