As a final group project, my team created an autonomous robot to play checkers against a human play, or even itself. This robot features several enhancemnts that I word heavily on, such as:
- Computer vision code that allows the camera to be moved varying distances from the board, as well as rotated
- Animatronics that work in tandem with a voice clone of our class TA
- A custom built checkers game that features 5 game modes
- An electromagent that picks up and drops pieces on command
