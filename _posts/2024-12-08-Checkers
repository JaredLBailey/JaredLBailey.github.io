As a final group project, my team and I created an autonomous robot to play checkers against a human play, or even itself. This robot features several enhancemnts that I word heavily on, such as:
- Computer vision code that allows the camera to be moved varying distances from the board, as well as rotated
- Animatronics that work in tandem with a voice clone of our class TA
- A custom built checkers game that features 5 game modes
- An electromagent that picks up and drops pieces on command

# The Brains Behind Leaflink: Raspberry Pi <a name="raspberry-pi"></a>

At the heart of Leaflink is a Raspberry Pi, which serves as the central processing unit of the entire system. This compact yet powerful device orchestrates all the sensors and actuators, ensuring seamless interaction between various components and effective management of the plant’s environment.

# Smart Light Management <a name="light"></a>

Plants need the right amount of light to thrive. Leaflink addresses this need with a light sensor. When the sensor detects that light levels are too low, it triggers LED lights encircling the plant, mimicking natural sunlight to ensure optimal growth conditions.

# Environmental Monitoring <a name="environment"></a>

Maintaining the ideal environment for plant growth is crucial. Leaflink uses s temperature and humidity sensor to continuously monitor and log these conditions. To provide actionable insights, we incorporated a LangChain agent that performs sophisticated graphing, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. This allows users to anticipate environmental changes and adjust care routines proactively.

# Soil Moisture and Watering System <a name="water"></a>

The system includes a soil moisture sensor that detects when the soil is too dry. When moisture levels drop below a certain threshold, Leaflink activates a motorized water pump to deliver water, ensuring your plant always has the right hydration.

# Automated Feeding <a name="food"></a>

In addition to watering, Leaflink manages plant nutrition through a motorized plant feeder controlled by a servo motor. This feature ensures that your plant receives regular, measured doses of nutrients, promoting robust growth and vitality.

# Master and Subordinate LLMs <a name="llms"></a>

Leaflink employs a master large language model (LLM) to coordinate various lower-level LLMs. These subordinate models handle specific tasks such as searching the internet for plant care tips, generating graphs and statistics, and performing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) lookups for detailed plant information. The master LLM also manages motor controls and interprets voice commands, translating them into JSON directives to operate the system’s components efficiently.

# Voice Interaction <a name="voice"></a>

Interacting with Leaflink is as simple as speaking to it. We’ve integrated a speech-to-text module to facilitate voice commands, making it easy to instruct the system or inquire about plant conditions. To enhance the user experience, we’ve even created a voice clone that mimics my own voice, giving the impression that the plant AI tool is genuinely alive (with its own personality) and engaged in conversation.

# Technology in Plant Care <a name="tech"></a>

Leaflink is more than just a plant maintenance tool; it represents an advancement in how technology can enhance our interaction with nature. By combining AI, IoT, and voice technology, we’ve created a system that not only simplifies plant care but also makes it more interactive and enjoyable. We’re excited about the potential of Leaflink and look forward to seeing how it evolves.
